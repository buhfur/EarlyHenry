# EarlyHenry
earlier (working) version of henry just without the majority of the commands built in 



This repo is an early version of my own personal assistant, made for only one specific purpose. However it has come to my attention that many developers have no idea where to start(at least i didnt).
so in order to give new programmers that "first push" into a project involving any kind of automation for a specific set of tasks.
This project however is not perfect, and is freely open to any kind of change in structure.
